# MATLAB-BioDiesel-Thermo


This code includes a thermodynamic analysis of the pre-treatment step in bio-diesel production.
Here oleic acid and and linoleic acid simulated in their conversion to their free fatty methyl 
ester counterparts. The work is in progress and other types of free fatty acids will be
add to understand the full picture of bio-diesel pre-treatment
